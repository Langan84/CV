## Skills

#### Thrives under pressure

As a self-employed contractor testing the quality of work produced by bank employees, I am used to working with several different banking clients. My role required a constant switching of priorities and work streams. I liaised daily with different clients including bank employees, claims management companies and customers in order to achieve a fair resolution. Sometimes this included difficult conversations when the correct guidance had not been followed and thus cases were failed. I also handled appeals on my decisions from internal teams directly. In terms of pace, working as a contractor I am used to working at a much quicker speed than a permanent employee to continually meet and exceed high targets and quality criteria required by the client. These contracts were often a five-day notice period, so there was no room for error.

#### Excellent communicator

As well as the financial services sector, I have been fortunate to have worked in several other fast-paced and customer facing environments throughout my career. An art gallery which was a heavily sales focussed role that required me to build up my own client database of regular art investors and collectors, and a hotel host for a large hotel chain abroad. These roles required a positive and flexible attitude. I thrive taking on new challenges and talking to and interacting with customers.

#### Analytical thinker

During my time as a self-contractor, I would go into banks and independently check the case handling processes and procedures, highlighting any gaps and offering advice in how to implement the required changes. Making processes more streamlined, helped staff to achieve a fair resolution first time around and reduce the margin for error in quality for the client. I have worked for many banks as an independent contractor including, Lloyds, Clydesdale bank, Yorkshire bank, Virgin Money and I also worked for several years at E-on, an energy provider. This demonstrates that I have an invaluable working knowledge of how these corporations work and years of experience in how to have tricky conversations when the quality and production isn’t quite right.

#### Adaptability & Flexibility

I can demonstrate my ability to adapt my role daily during my career. I’m used to jumping onto different workstreams and I was an experienced Subject Matter Expert. I have ‘floor walked’ bank offices many times helping with all manner of queries. I enjoy undertaking many roles and always have an itch to learn something new.

#### Fast learner

I have an appetite for learning that has enabled me to teach myself code and then take a chance on Makers Academy and change what was already a well-established career. I would value the opportunity to continue my learning pace in a new role.
